\section*{Release Statement}
This software is in the pre-alpha development stage meaning that perfect performance is not guaranteed. It is highly likely that there are many bugs remaining in the code and it is probable that the framework may not be compatible with all MATLAB versions and Airbus FAME models. In the event of an unexplained error the user is requested to inform the developers of the framework, providing sufficient detail (barring commercially sensitive information) such that the error can be replicated and solved.
