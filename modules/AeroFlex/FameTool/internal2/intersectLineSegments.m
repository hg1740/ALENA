function [xi, yi, index] = intersectLineSegments(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4)
%INTERSECTLINESEGMENTS Intersect pairs of line segments
%
% Given column vectors in which each element represents a coordinate
% in a different pair of line segments, locate all the intersections
% such that the line segment connecting x1(k), y1(k) to x2(k), y2(k)
% intersects the segment connecting x3(k), y3(k) to x4(k), y4(k).
% Return the result in a pair of column vectors xi, yi along with an
% an index (a column vector that matches xi and yi in size) that
% indicates the pair number to which each element of xi and yi
% corresponds. In cases in which the two segments are collinear and
% overlapping, return two points of intersection -  - the points at
% which the overlap begins and ends, unless the overlap itself is
% limited to a single point.

% If possible, we're going to use p1 and p2 to define a similarity
% transformation, but we can't do that if they coincide. And if they are
% very close, there could be unnecessary loss of precision as well. So we
% start out by swapping p1 and p2 with P3 and P4 if P3 and P4 are further
% apart than p1 and p2 ... with these exceptions: Never swap if p1 and p2
% are distinct and fall exactly on a perfectly vertical or horizontal line,
% and always swap if p1 and p2 do not fall on a vertical or horizontal line
% but P3 and P4 are distinct and do fall on a perfectly vertical or
% horizontal line. By maintaining these exceptions, we can be assured that
% intersections involving collinear points on perfectly vertical or
% horizontal lines will not be altered or missed due to floating point
% imprecision.
