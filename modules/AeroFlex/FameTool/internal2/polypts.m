function [xi, yi, ii] = polypts(x1, y1, x2, y2, filterCode)
%POLYPTS Intersection points for lines or polygon edges
%
% [XI,YI] = POLYPTS(X1,Y1,X2,Y2) returns the intersection points of
% two polylines in a planar, Cartesian system. X1 and Y1 are vectors
% containing the x - and y - coordinates of the vertices in the first
% polyline, and X2 and Y2 contain the vertices in the second polyline.
% The output variables, XI and YI, are column vectors containing the
% x - and y - coordinates of each point at which a segment of the first
% polyline intersects a segment of the second. In the case of
% overlapping, collinear segments, the intersection is actually a line
% segment rather than a point, and both endpoints are included in XI, YI.
%
% [XI,YI,II] = POLYPTS(...) returns a two - column array of line
% segment indices corresponding to the intersection points. The k - th
% row of II indicates which polyline segments give rise to the
% intersection point XI(k), YI(k). To remember how these indices work,
% just think of segments and vertices as fence sections and posts. The
% i - th fence section connects the i - th post to the (i + 1) - th post. In
% general, letting i and j denote the scalar values comprised by the
% k - th row of II, the intersection indicated by that row occurs where
% the i - th segment of the first polyline intersects the j - th segment
% of the second polyline. But when an intersection falls precisely on
% a vertex of the first polyline, then i is the index of that vertex.
% Likewise with the second polyline and the index j. In the case of an
% intersection at the i - th vertex of the first line, for example,
% XI(k) equals X1(i) and YI(k) equals Y1(i). In the case of
% intersections between vertices, i and j can be interpreted as
% follows: the segment connecting X1(i), Y1(i) to X1(i + 1), Y1(i + 1)
% intersects the segment connecting X2(j), Y2(j) to X2(j + 1), Y2(j + 1)
% at the point XI(k), YI(k).
%
% [XI,YI] = POLYPTS(...,'unique') filters out duplicate intersections,
% which may result if the input polylines are self - intersecting.

% Example
%  -------
% % Define and fill a rectangular area in the plane
% xlimit = [3 13];
% ylimit = [2 8];
% xbox = xlimit([1 1 2 2 1]);
% ybox = ylimit([1 2 2 1 1]);
% mapshow(xbox,ybox,'DisplayType','polygon','LineStyle','none')
%
% % Define and display a two - part polyline
% x = [0 6 4 8 8 10 14 10 14 NaN 4 4 6 9 15];
% y = [4 6 10 11 7 6 10 10 6 NaN 0 3 4 3 6];
% mapshow(x,y,'Marker',' + ')
%
% % Intersect the polyline with the rectangle
% [xi, yi] = polypts(x, y, xbox, ybox);
% mapshow(xi,yi,'DisplayType','point','Marker','o')
%
% % Display the intersection points; note that the point (12, 8) appears
% % twice because of a self - intersection near the end of the first part
% % of the polyline.

% % You could suppress this duplicate by using the 'unique' option.
