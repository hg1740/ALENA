## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Updated drawing so can easily pan and zoom
- Added beam stress and strain output in ALENA format
- Added option to enable gravity for static nonlinear Nastran solution
- Added CTRLDEF option for nonlinear analysis and IDAMP artificial damping
- Added the Matran git repo as a submodule (with the aim of moving all nastran 
	specific methods to this repo with time) https://github.com/farg-bristol/Matran
- Added ability to change the twist of the wing wing span (which is then created
	via DMI cards in the Nastran output)
- Added a A321 model example that completes a sol144 and sol146 gust analysis
### Changed
- Enabled large rotation offset for beams with a shear centre offset (static nonlinear Nastran solution)
- Example sub folders are now added to the path via the 'addsandbox' method
- printing 'trim file' (SOL144 file) card printing switched to Matran printinig methods
- Changed how NAstran path deals with spaces to make it system agnostic
- Changed Hodges wing example to vary the twist along the span
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
- Fixed bug plotting wings with control surfaces
- Fixed recersion issues with ort check
- Fixed hinge direction + added DMI card
- Fixed indentation
- Fixed LOAD card structure
- Fixed .f06 output to get full grid displacement vectors
- Fixed force/moment entry overflowing into adjacent field
- Fixed bug which throw an error if fo6 did not exist
- Fixed 'random' printing of the word 'close' to the matlab command prompt

## [1.0.0.0] - 2021-04-07
### Added
- Drawing a line in the sand under current development and specifing it as version 1
- Current static nonlinear funtionality:
	- Generating an ALENA object for a beam
	- Generating an ALENA object for a lifting surface using various parameterization methods
	- Object parameters and properties can be varied along its span at user defined points
	- Setting up coordinate systems
	- Defining beam section orientation
	- Applying point forces and moments (including follower loads) at user defined locations along a beam
	- Adding point masses which will automatically be rigidly attached to closest grid point in Nastran FE model
	- Creating Nastran input files, running Nastran, and extracting results in ALENA format
- Current FWT functionality
	- can define a floating FWT as part of a lifting surface
